# TrackBeat

The metronome project is web based metronome for musicians who want to track their metronome practice routine.

## Motivation

Most musicians use a metronome to practice new techniques, songs, and time signatures. The metronome allows a musician to reference a pulse in perfect time so they can correct rhythmic inconsitencies. As a musician myself, I too use a meteronome daily in order to perfect my musicial abilities, however, I have yet found a web based metronome app which tracks my progress.

One app that I use frequently is [metronomeonline](https://www.metronomeonline.com/), a web based metronome with loads of features and a timer to keep track practice session length. I love the way the metronome is laid out, but it does have its issues:

1. I cannot track in days how much or little I've been practicing with a metronome for the given week.
2. The bpm's are preselected, this can be a problem if a song has a bpm not available in the predefined list.
3. The timer keeps track of how long you have practiced for the session, but if you refresh the page, your progress goes right back to zero.

There is a similar app, called `Soundbrenner`, which already implements a solution to the given problems above, however this app is only available ios and the google play store. Here is a link to the their google play if you are interested: [Soundbrenner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.soundbrenner.pulse&hl=en_US). Personally I find myself practicing in front of my laptop/desktop so I can read pdf sheet music and change metronome settings on my browser of choice. This gives me a central location where to practice my instrument.
